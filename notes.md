# Maze Generator and Solver

## Description
A program that generates random mazes and finds solutiions to navigate through them.

## Requirements
### Maze Generation
The maze will be represented as a 2D grid in which each cell is either traversible or not traversible. The maze will be generated using Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm.
### Pathfinding and Maze Solving
Implement Dijikstra's algorithm to find the shortest route from the entrance point to the exit point.
### User Interaction
Allow the user to pick the size, start, and end points.
### Visualizatiion
Use some library(ies) to display the maze visually.
